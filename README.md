# Intro to MATLAB Final Project
Final Project for introductory MATLAB class. Created a snake game solely using MATLAB with a starting screen, game screen, and end screen. For reference exact line by line comments can be found in the code files. This snake game is a remake of the retro snake game where a user tries to eat as many apples as possible without hitting the edge or yourself! The code is divided into a few main files: snake_ui (responsible for the creation of the starting screen), board_setup (sets up variables to be used on the snake board in game mechanics), game_mechanics (responsible for the main development behind controling the snake and playing the game), click (responsible for relating computer keypresses to usable variables), snaketester (the file that runs the game), game_over (the file responsible for the game_over screens) and credits (references the images used).
